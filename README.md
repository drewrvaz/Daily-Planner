# Daily-Planner

## Description
I wanted to create a daily planner that would allow me to input data into time slots. I also wanted to be able to save the inputs so I could go back to look at them the next day, or so I could change them the next day. This planner is a simple way to keep track of the things I have to do throughout the day. I learned that Google remains a web developer's best friend, that coding is way easier when you do it with other people, and how to use JQuery.

## Usage
In order to use the planner, you need to click on the time slot you want to add your item to. You can type your item into the text field and then click the SD card to save it.
